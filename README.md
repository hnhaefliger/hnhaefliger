- :seedling: Currently learning more about: Emulators and low-level functionality.

#### Here are some of the things that I'm working on

---

### Web Apps
---

- :handshake: [Crowdbyte](https://github.com) is a platform for human artificial swarm intelligence. It was inspired by the work of [Unanimous.ai](https://unanimous.ai) whose interesting work is unfortunately not open source. A host can set up a consensus session at the [/host](https://crowdbyte.com/host) url and players can join at [/room](https://crowdbyte.co/room) using the room id. They then vote by competing in a physics simulation to pull a puck towards their choice with a magnet. The project was built using Django, Django Channels and JavaScript websockets.
- :gear: [Investutils](https://github.com) is a unified API for different sources of investment data to be used with future applications. It gathers company info from websites such as Yahoo Finance and regularly checks which tickers are available on exchanges like robinhood. I also plan to combine it with my [other repository](https://github.com) for media analysis which finds potentially interesting stocks by counting their mentions on websites such as reddit. It was built using Django and Django rest framework.

### Machine Learning
---

- :framed_picture: [Phorama](https://github.com) is an implementation of different generative adversial networks such as SRGAN and UNet for neural image superresolution. These were implemented using Tensorflow and Keras.
- :smiley: [Happy](https://github.com) is a refactor of the personal digital assistant I built from scratch. Happy itself is still largely a work in progress but the original code can be found in my [other repository](https://github.com). The first time around, I developed the models using Tensorflow and Keras but this time I am using PyTorch because it has more built in audio utilities and to get more exposure to another framework.

### Other
---

- :performing_arts: [Gerrymandering](https://github.com) is a proof of concept for algorithmic gerrymandering. It uses data published by [OpenPrecincts](https://openprecincts.org) to build a state election map for Pennsylvania. It then gradually edits the voting districts by flipping neighboring precincts to optimize for equal population, district perimeter to area ratio, average precinct distance from district and of course desired voting outcomes. There is still some work to be done to speed up the perimeter and area calculations for the irregular shapes and to prevent districts from being 'cut in half' by other, expanding districts.
- :ice_cube: [Pyengine3d](https://github.com) was an attempt to understand 3D graphics by building an engine using only the python standard library. It also spawned several side projects like [pyrubiks](https://github.com) and [pyterrain](https://github.com).
- :package: [Bittorrent](https://github.com) is a simple bittorrent client build on python's sockets and threading libraries and based on the bittorrent spec.
- (:computer: [Emulators](https://github.com)) are what I am currently working on. The works in progress are CHIP-8, NES (6502), and a TI calculator (Z80).
