### Hi! I'm Henry ðŸ‘‹

- :seedling: Currently learning more about: Emulators and low-level functionality.

#### Here are some of the things that I'm working on

### Web Apps

- :handshake: [Crowdbyte]() is a platform for human artificial swarm intelligence. It was inspired by the work of [Unanimous.ai](https://unanimous.ai) whose interesting work is unfortunately not open source. A host can set up a consensus session at the [/host](https://crowdbyte.com/host) url and players can join at [/room](https://crowdbyte.co/room) using the room id. They then vote by competing in a physics simulation to pull a puck towards their choice with a magnet. The project was built using Django, Django Channels and JavaScript websockets.
