### Hi! I'm Henry ðŸ‘‹

- :seedling: Currently learning more about: Emulators and low-level functionality.

#### Here are some of the things that I'm working on

### Web Apps

- :handshake: [Crowdbyte](https://github.com) is a platform for human artificial swarm intelligence. It was inspired by the work of [Unanimous.ai](https://unanimous.ai) whose interesting work is unfortunately not open source. A host can set up a consensus session at the [/host](https://crowdbyte.com/host) url and players can join at [/room](https://crowdbyte.co/room) using the room id. They then vote by competing in a physics simulation to pull a puck towards their choice with a magnet. The project was built using Django, Django Channels and JavaScript websockets.
- :gear: [Investutils](https://github.com) is a unified API for different sources of investment data to be used with future applications. It gathers company info from websites such as Yahoo Finance and regularly checks which tickers are available on exchanges like robinhood. I also plan to combine it with my [other repository](https://github.com) for media analysis which finds potentially interesting stocks by counting their mentions on websites such as reddit.
